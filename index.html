            <p>I was born in December 2016 in San Bernadino county, near San Gabriel mountains.  When I was six weeks old, 
            my parents adopted my sister and I and moved us to San Diego.  
            We settled in a nice house with big back yard in a dog friendly neighborhood.  

            During day time, my sister, <a href="kelsey.html">Kelsey</a>, and I are home alone in the backyard.  There are not
            much things to do.  Kelsey and I do not get along so we fight alot.  Sometimes one of us will get 
            injured and will need medical attention. However, we do play together othertimes.

            One of the thing I enjoy the most is taking a walk in the evening with my family since I 
            can meet a lot of other dogs in the area.  Some of the dogs have quite interesting ways to say hello.
